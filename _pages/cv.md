Research & Projects
=======
* MSIP: Study on multi-source infection pattern mining algorithm in 4D spacetime (Jan 2022 - Nov 2022)
  * Modeled the problem of the mining of dynamic multi-source infection events in real four-dimensional space- time as the multi-source infection pattern (MSIP) model, which considered multi-source infection, movement trajectory, and spatio-temporal dimension at the same time.
  * Proposed infection pattern mining algorithm based on opportunity (MABO) under the MSIP model.
  * Conducted experiments on a real-life dataset and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm; experiment results proved the proposed algorithm successfully mined possible infection events and accurately imitated the real environment.
  * Optimized the algorithm with sliding window.
  * Visualized the result of spacetime infection pattern with Echarts.
