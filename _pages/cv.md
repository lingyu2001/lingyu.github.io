Research & Projects
=======
* ** MSIP: Study on multi-source infection pattern mining algorithm in 4D spacetime (Jan 2022 - Nov 2022)**
  * Modeled the problem of the mining of dynamic multi-source infection events in real four-dimensional space- time as the multi-source infection pattern (MSIP) model, which considered multi-source infection, movement trajectory, and spatio-temporal dimension at the same time.
  * Proposed infection pattern mining algorithm based on opportunity (MABO) under the MSIP model.
  * Conducted experiments on a real-life dataset and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm; experiment results proved the proposed algorithm successfully mined possible infection events and accurately imitated the real environment.
  * Optimized the algorithm with sliding window.
  * Visualized the result of spacetime infection pattern with Echarts.

* ** Real-Time Processing, Analysis and Visualization of Big Data from Blog Search Engine Based on Storm and Kafka Frames (Dec 2021 - Jan 2022)**
  * Developed basic search engine with Spring Boot, Lucene, and WebMagic to provide key functions of keyword searching; deployed front-end site to Tomcat and Nginx.
  * Built a dataset with 50K+ data points; individual contributions include: Data crawling, pre-processing, and cleaning.
  * Used Kafka and Storm for real-time data analysis and persisted the results to MySQL database.


Work experience
======
** Internship of Data Analysis in Big Data Department in Digital Hainan (Feb 2021 - Mar 2021)**
  * Acquired theoretical and practical knowledge about Alibaba Cloud platform, data collection, cleaning, modeling, storage, visualization, data tagging and user profiling.
  * Mined user behaviors, preferences, and basic information to produce user tags to support business scenarios.
  * Used SQL for data analysis and processing.

* **Mar 2021 - Apr 2021: Volunteer in Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2021**
