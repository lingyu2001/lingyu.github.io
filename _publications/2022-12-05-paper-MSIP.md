The existing contagion patterns lack the mining of dynamic multi-source infection events in real four-dimensional space-time, which reduces the applicability of the current research results. To address the shortcomings and challenges of existing research work, we investigate the multi-source infection pattern mining algorithm for infectious dynamics in four-dimensional space-time. In this paper, the multi- source infection pattern (MSIP) model is first defined in four-dimensional spacetime. The proposed model considers elements that are more accurate to the real environment, including multi-source infection, movement trajectory, and spatio-temporal dimension. The infection pattern mining al- gorithm based on opportunity (MABO) is proposed under the MSIP model. The result of the experiment demonstrates that MABO performs effectively, which can mine more infected events under multi-source infection conditions.
